# Twitter (X) Hateful Conduct Policy

Twitter prohibits promoting violence against or directly attacking or threatening other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.

We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.

Hateful imagery and display names are not permitted in profile images, header images, or background images.

Content that dehumanizes others based on their membership in an identifiable group will be removed, even if it does not directly target a specific person.

We prohibit targeting individuals with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to dehumanize, degrade or reinforce negative stereotypes about a protected category.

Consequences for violating this policy may include tweet deletion requirements, placing tweets behind an interstitial, and permanent account suspension.

Context matters: discussion of political policies, historical events, or exposing hateful conduct is permitted if the intent is not to promote these attitudes.
