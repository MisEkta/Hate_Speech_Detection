# United States Laws on Hate Speech and Hate Crimes

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech, including hate speech, unless it directly incites imminent lawless action or constitutes a "true threat" of violence.

The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 criminalizes willfully causing bodily injury (or attempting to do so with fire, firearm, or other dangerous weapon) when the crime was committed because of actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

Title 18, U.S.C., Section 245 prohibits interference with federally protected activities based on race, color, religion, or national origin.

Title 42, U.S.C., Section 3631 criminalizes interference with housing rights based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin.

Many states have their own hate crime laws that enhance penalties for crimes motivated by bias.

The Communications Decency Act generally shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, but platforms can establish and enforce their own content policies.

The Justice Department can investigate and prosecute hate crimes when local authorities cannot or will not do so, but cannot prosecute hate speech unless it constitutes a true threat, incitement to imminent lawless action, or harassment.
