# Reddit Content Policy on Hate Speech and Harassment

Reddit prohibits content that promotes hate based on identity or vulnerability, including race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.

Posts, comments, and communities that attack marginalized or vulnerable groups may be removed and may result in user bans or community quarantine.

Content that incites violence, dehumanizes individuals, or promotes segregation will be removed immediately.

Repeated violations will result in permanent suspension of accounts.

Reddit encourages respectful discussion of controversial topics but draws a clear line when content targets protected groups.

The platform may take context into account when determining if content violates this policy, including satire, education, or artistic expression.

Moderators are required to enforce these standards within their communities.
